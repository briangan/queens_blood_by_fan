# ElasticSearch

==================================
How to run ElasticSearch: Elastic Cloud vs OnePremises/OnPrem
* Elastic Cloud
  * runs on Elastic Servers in diff clouds
  * no knowledge needed to operate the Stack
  * only knowledge to ingest data and use UI
  * availables on: Google Cloud, AWS, Azure
  * monthly costs
  
* OnePremises
  * hosts in ur own environment
  * knowledge needed to operate the Stack
  * knowledge to ingest data and use the UI
  * deployable to ur Servers
  * free or annual costs if license has been purchased

====================================
Design ElasticSearch

For production Servers
* if using other paid services, calculate sizes b4 ordering
* use multiple nodes (server)
* for example, one ES server is divided into 3 indices
  * spread out among 3 nodes, w/ each index available on 2 nodes, in other words,
    2 copies of one index on diff nodes
    Node 1  [Index 1][Index 2]
    Node 2  [Index 1][Index 3]
    Node 3  [Index 3][Index 2]
* other hot nodes (fastest servers, actively used), may implement some warm & cold nodes
  * warm - bigger storage but slower processing; suggestion: copy from hot to warm after 2 days
  * cold - more bigger storage but slower processing; suggestion: copy from hot to warm after 5 days


=======================================
Using Docker to Run ES

One on https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html
Set .env w/ passwords and settings
docker-compose.yml w/ 
  array of nodes w/ diff persistent storage & settings, command, health_check
  SSL certificates (key, crt, and ca signed crt) for access and transport (node communication w/ another)
  kibana - conditions to check health of nodes, volumes
